# CAPSTONE_MGBD
The majority  of work has been done on jupyter notebook and where needed using google colab given the volume of data as we were hitting performance and memory issues.

Here you will find 3 jupyter notebooks.
1) EDA - > Takes into account all datasets available and joins them up together, creating a single dataframe that is used for the following purposes.
2) TSF -> implements prophet, Random Forest regressor and XGboost alongside visualisations to perform time series forecasting.
3) Data clustering -> further data manipulation to prepare datasets needed to feed Dataiku for segmentation.

Also, we have included:
- report_output -> Panda's profiling report.
- Clustering -> folder that contains two subfoldersw. The first one with a clustering by channel and a second one with the clustering by stores.
